Triggers are the entry point of every workflow. When a trigger fires, the workflow begins executing from that node. Each workflow can have exactly one trigger.

## Manual Trigger

<Card title="Manual Trigger" icon="play">
  Run your workflow on demand by clicking the **Run** button in the editor toolbar.
</Card>

The simplest trigger type. No configuration required. Click **Run** in the editor and the workflow executes immediately. Best for workflows you want to run yourself, like one off tasks or testing.

**Variable name:** Not applicable (no input data)

## Input Trigger

<Card title="Input Trigger" icon="text-cursor-input">
  Define a custom form with typed fields. Users fill it out before each run.
</Card>

Create a form with custom fields that must be filled out before the workflow runs. This is ideal when your workflow needs specific information each time, like a name, URL, or file.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Variable name** | How you reference the input data in downstream nodes (default: `inputTrigger`) |
| **Fields** | Add as many fields as you need. Each has a name and a type. |

**Supported field types:**

- **String** — Single line text
- **Number** — Numeric value
- **Boolean** — True or false toggle

- **Array** — JSON array
- **Files** — File attachments (base64 encoded)

## Webhook Trigger

<Card title="Webhook Trigger" icon="webhook">

## Chat Trigger

<Card title="Chat Trigger" icon="message-square">
  Start your workflow from a conversational chat interface inside the editor.

This trigger is great for building AI powered chatbots and assistants. Each message starts a new workflow execution, and the conversation history is maintained in the chat window.
