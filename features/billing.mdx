## Plans

Innflow offers four pricing tiers:

| Plan | Price | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Free** | $0/mo | $5 in monthly usage credits. 1 workspace, limited tables. |
| **Pro** | $20/mo | Unlimited workflows, all premium nodes, up to 3 team workspaces. |
| **Team** | $40/mo | Everything in Pro plus unlimited workspaces and members. |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Extended retention, custom limits, dedicated support. |

## Usage Credits

Innflow uses a credit system based on actual usage. Each workflow execution consumes credits depending on the nodes it runs, especially AI and external API calls.

Your credit balance is visible in the sidebar. It shows your remaining balance out of your monthly allowance.

### Low Balance Warnings

- **Low balance** — You are approaching your monthly limit
- **Critical balance** — You have very little credit remaining and workflows may stop executing
