The Copilot is an AI assistant built into the workflow editor. Describe what you want in plain English and the Copilot will create nodes, connect them, and configure your workflow for you.

## Opening the Copilot

Click the **sparkles icon** in the editor sidebar to open the Copilot panel. You can have multiple conversation threads and switch between them.

## What the Copilot Can Do

<Columns cols={2}>

  </Card>
</Columns>

## Context Aware Suggestions

When you open the Copilot, it reads your current workflow state (what nodes you have, how they are connected, what is configured) and tailors its suggestions. For example:

- **Empty workflow:** "Add a trigger to get started" or "Build a workflow from a description"
- **Has trigger, no actions:** "Add an AI node to process the input" or "Connect to Slack to send notifications"
- **Complete workflow:** "Run the workflow" or "Add error handling"

## Conversation Threads

The Copilot maintains separate conversation threads so you can work on different aspects of your workflow independently. Use the dropdown at the top of the panel to create a new thread or switch between existing ones.
