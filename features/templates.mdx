Templates are pre built workflows you can clone and customize. Browse the gallery to find automations for your use case, or publish your own workflows as templates for the community.

## Browsing Templates

Go to the **Templates** page to browse the gallery. You can:

- **Search** by keyword to find specific templates
- **Filter by role** (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Engineering) using the sidebar filters
- **Filter by use case** to narrow down results
- **View featured templates** highlighted at the top of the page

Click any template card to see a detailed preview with description, node breakdown, and a **Use Template** button.
