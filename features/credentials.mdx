Credentials are the connections between Innflow and your external accounts. When you connect a service like Google, Slack, or Microsoft, Innflow stores the OAuth tokens securely so your workflows can interact with those services.

## Connecting a Service

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Credentials">
    Navigate to **Settings → Credentials** from the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a new credential">
    Click **New Credential** and choose the service you want to connect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    You will be redirected to the service's authorization page. Grant Innflow the permissions it needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ready to use">
    The credential now appears in your list and is available in any workflow node that requires it.
  </Step>
</Steps>
