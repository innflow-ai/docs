API keys let you interact with Innflow programmatically. Use them to trigger workflows from your own applications, scripts, or external services.

## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings → API Keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a key">
    Click **New API Key**. Give it a descriptive name and choose an expiration period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the key">
    The full API key is shown **only once** after creation. Copy it and store it securely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expiration Options

| Option | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| 30 days | Short lived, good for temporary integrations |
| 90 days | Medium term access |
| 1 year | Long term access |
| Never | Does not expire (use with caution) |

## Managing Keys

- View all your API keys with their creation date, last used date, and request count
- **Revoke** a key to immediately disable it
- Keys show a masked preview (first few characters) for identification

<Callout type="warning">
  Treat API keys like passwords. Do not commit them to version control or share them publicly. If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately and create a new one.
