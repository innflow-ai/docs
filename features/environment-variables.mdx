Environment variables let you store sensitive values (API keys, tokens, configuration strings) outside of your workflow definitions. Reference them in any node without hardcoding secrets.

## Creating an Environment Variable

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings → Environment Variables**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a variable">
    Click **New Variable**. Enter a name and value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use in workflows">
    Reference the variable in any node configuration field.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Naming Rules

Environment variable names must:
- Start with an **uppercase letter**
- Contain only **uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores**
- Be at most **100 characters**

**Examples:** `API_KEY`, `SLACK_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`

## Security

- Values are **encrypted at rest** and never displayed in plain text after creation
- When editing a variable, you must re enter the value (the current value is not shown)
- Variables are scoped to your workspace and not shared across workspaces

## Using in Workflows

Environment variables are available through the variable picker in any node configuration field. Select from the environment variables section to inject the value at runtime.
