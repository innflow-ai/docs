## Build Your First Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new workflow">
    From the **Workflows** page, click **New Workflow**. This opens the visual editor where you build automations by connecting nodes on a canvas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a trigger">
    Every workflow starts with a trigger. Click the starting node and choose one:

    - **Manual Trigger** — Run the workflow on demand with the **Run** button
    - **Input Trigger** — Define a form with custom fields that users fill out before each run
    - **Webhook Trigger** — Start the workflow when an external system sends an HTTP request
    - **Chat Trigger** — Start the workflow from a conversational chat interface
    - **Schedule Trigger** — Run automatically on a recurring schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, hourly)
    - **Stripe, Typeform, Notion, Google Forms** — Start when events happen in those services

    For your first workflow, **Manual Trigger** is the simplest choice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add action nodes">
    Click the **+** button below your trigger to add nodes. Browse by category or search for what you need:

    - **AI** — Generate text with Gemini models
    - **Communication** — Send messages via Slack, Discord, Gmail, Teams, Telegram, or Resend
    - **Google Suite** — Work with Docs, Sheets, Calendar, Drive, Slides, Forms, and Groups
    - **Microsoft** — Excel, Word, OneDrive, Outlook, Planner, SharePoint, and Teams
    - **Data** — Airtable, HubSpot, Apollo, Notion, Trello, GitHub
    - **Search** — Tavily, Exa, Firecrawl, Ahrefs, Polymarket
    - **Logic** — Conditions, routers, code execution, array transforms, sleep, CSV export
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect and configure">
    Drag from one node's output handle to another node's input handle to create connections. Click any node to open its configuration panel on the right side.

    Use `{{variableName.output.field}}` syntax to reference data from previous nodes. The variable picker (click the `{ }` icon in any text field) shows all available variables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your workflow">
    Click the **Run** button in the editor toolbar. You will see each node execute in sequence, with status indicators showing progress. Click any completed node to inspect its output.
  </Step>
</Steps>
