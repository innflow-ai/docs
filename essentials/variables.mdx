## Template Variables

Variables allow you to pass data dynamically between nodes using the `{{variable}}` syntax.

## Basic Syntax

Reference a variable by wrapping its path in double curly braces:

```
{{nodeName.output.fieldName}}
```

## Examples

### Accessing Node Output

If you have a node named `ai_generate` that outputs text:

```
{{ai_generate.output.text}}
```

### Accessing Trigger Data

For webhook triggers with JSON payload:

```
{{trigger.body.email}}
{{trigger.body.name}}
```

### Nested Objects

Access nested properties with dot notation:

```
{{airtable.output.record.fields.Name}}
{{slack.output.message.ts}}
```

## Variable Picker

The editor includes a variable picker that shows available variables from previous nodes. Click the `{ }` button in any text field to open it.

## Type Coercion

Variables are automatically converted to strings when used in text fields. For nodes expecting specific types (numbers, arrays), the value is passed as-is.

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive node names** - Makes variables easier to understand
- **Check for existence** - Some outputs may be undefined
- **Keep paths simple** - Extract nested data in intermediate nodes if needed
