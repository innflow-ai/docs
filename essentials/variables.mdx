## Template Variables

Variables let you pass data from one node to another using the `{{variableName.output.field}}` syntax. Every node that produces output stores it under a variable name you define.

## Basic Syntax

Reference any value by wrapping its path in double curly braces:

```
{{nodeName.output.fieldName}}
```

## Common Patterns

### Trigger Data

```
{{inputTrigger.name}}
{{webhookTrigger.body.email}}
{{chatTrigger.message}}
```

### Node Output

```
{{gemini_response.output.text}}
{{search_results.output.results}}
{{http_response.output.data}}
```

### Nested Properties

Use dot notation to access nested values:

```
{{airtable.output.record.fields.Name}}
{{gmail.output.messages[0].subject}}
```

## Variable Picker

Every text field in the node configuration panel includes a **variable picker**. Click the `{ }` button to open it. The picker shows:

- All upstream nodes and their output fields
- Trigger data fields
- [Environment variables](/features/environment-variables)

Select a variable to insert it at your cursor position.

## Variable Names

Each node has a configurable **variable name** that determines how downstream nodes reference its output. Choose descriptive names to keep your workflows readable:

- ✅ `customer_email` → `{{customer_email.output.text}}`
- ❌ `node_7` → `{{node_7.output.text}}`

## Type Handling

Variables are automatically converted to strings when used in text fields. For nodes that expect specific types (numbers, arrays, objects), the raw value is passed through without conversion.

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive variable names** — Makes your workflow self documenting
- **Check for existence** — Some outputs may be undefined if a previous node was skipped
- **Keep paths simple** — If you need deeply nested data, use a Code or Transform Array node to extract it first
