## What is a Workflow?

A workflow is an automated sequence of actions that executes when triggered. Workflows are built visually by connecting nodes together in the drag and drop editor.

## Workflow Structure

Every workflow consists of:

1. **Trigger** — The starting point that initiates execution. Each workflow has exactly one trigger.
2. **Nodes** — Individual actions or operations (AI generation, sending emails, data lookups, etc.)
3. **Connections** — Links between nodes that define the execution order
4. **Context** — Shared data passed between nodes via [template variables](/essentials/variables)

## The Visual Editor

The editor is a canvas where you build workflows by placing and connecting nodes. Key interactions:

- **Add nodes** — Click the **+** button on any node or drag from the sidebar
- **Connect nodes** — Drag from an output handle to an input handle
- **Configure nodes** — Click or double click a node to open its settings panel on the right
- **Move nodes** — Drag nodes to rearrange the layout
- **Delete nodes** — Select a node and press Delete, or use the context menu

## Execution Flow

When a workflow runs:

1. The trigger node activates
2. Each connected node executes in sequence
3. Output from each node is added to the workflow context
4. Subsequent nodes can access previous outputs via [variables](/essentials/variables)
5. Branching nodes (Condition, Router) can split execution into parallel paths

## Workflow States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Draft | Workflow is being edited |
| Active | Workflow is ready to run |
| Running | Workflow is currently executing |
| Completed | Workflow finished successfully |
| Failed | Workflow encountered an error |

## Execution History

Each workflow run is logged with the status of every node. Click on a completed execution to see what each node produced. Execution history retention depends on your [plan](/features/billing):

- **Free:** 1 day
- **Pro / Team:** 30 days
- **Enterprise:** 90 days

## Using the Copilot

The [Copilot](/features/copilot) can build and modify workflows using natural language. Open it from the sidebar sparkles icon.

## Best Practices

- **Keep workflows focused** — Each workflow should do one thing well
- **Use descriptive names** — Name nodes clearly so variables are easy to understand
- **Test incrementally** — Run and verify after adding each node
- **Use environment variables** — Store secrets in [environment variables](/features/environment-variables) instead of hardcoding them
