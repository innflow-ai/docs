## What is a Workflow?

A workflow is an automated sequence of actions that executes when triggered. Workflows are built visually by connecting nodes together in the editor.

## Workflow Structure

Every workflow consists of:

1. **Trigger** - The starting point that initiates execution
2. **Nodes** - Individual actions or operations
3. **Connections** - Links that define the execution order
4. **Context** - Shared data passed between nodes

## Execution Flow

When a workflow runs:

1. The trigger node activates
2. Each connected node executes in sequence
3. Output from each node is added to the context
4. Subsequent nodes can access previous outputs via variables

## Workflow States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Draft | Workflow is being edited |
| Active | Workflow is ready to run |
| Running | Workflow is currently executing |
| Completed | Workflow finished successfully |
| Failed | Workflow encountered an error |

## Best Practices

- **Keep workflows focused** - Each workflow should do one thing well
- **Use descriptive names** - Name nodes and workflows clearly
- **Test incrementally** - Run and verify after adding each node
- **Handle errors** - Add error handling for critical operations
